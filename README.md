# Horiseon - Open Source (Horiseon-Refactoring-Update)
<p>
A preexisting code from the Horiseon website was refactored to improve its accessibility. The code was improved without changing its functionality. The motivation for refactoring the code was the need to make the aplication more accessible. By doing this, it will help future coders better understad the written code and be able to create further improvements to the website.
</p>

<p>
Visual Studio Code was used to refactor the code. An html and a css files were used to alter the code and Github pages were used to publish the aplicationon the web. The "Inspect" feature was used to help visualize code and code alterations before making the changes permanent. 
</p>

<p>
Some chanllenges faced while refactoring the code, included a lower understanding for certain Visual Studio Code features at the begining of the refactoring. For example, selecting the right elements and selectors to make the aplication look the same as the original code, took longer since certain elements did not work as anticipated. However, I was able to learn more about it with time and I succesfully used the different features form Visual Studio Code. Some features I hope to implement in the future include to java script and css bootstrap to make the aplication more functional.
</p>

<p>
From working on this project, I learned that there are many ways to refactor code. Different people are going to take different approaches to alter the code without the application loosing its functionality and it does not mean that one person is doing a better job than others. 
</p>

## Installation
<p>
To be able to work on the Code, cloning the Horiseon-Refactoring-Update repo from [Github](https://github.com/OcampMaria) to a local machine might be necessary.
</p>

<p>
Once cloned into a personal or local machine trhough the Git Bash Terminal, the code will be available for use and be updated. A new repo on the coder's personal Github account will be needed to push any changes made to the code and to upload the aplication to the web. Constant savings through git push will be necessary to prevent loss of code updates
</p>

<p>
When the coder has finished refactoring, the files can be pushed or uploaded to Github through the Git Bash Terminal. Once on Github, the aplicaition can become live through Github Pages. After this, the aplication should be available to the public. 
</p>

<p>The application should look like the images below. </p>

## Usage
<p>
The application can be accessed through th github pages link.
</p>
<p> The application contains three selection buttons on the right top corner of the page. These are placed there for easy access. They will direct the person using the application to the three different information sections of the page as needed.
