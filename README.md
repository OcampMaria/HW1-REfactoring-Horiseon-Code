# Horiseon - Open Source (Horiseon-Refactoring-Update)
A preexisting code from the Horiseon website was refactored to improve its accessibility. The code was improved without changing its functionality. 
 
 Visual Studio Code was used to refactor the code. an html and a css files were needed to make the aplication work correctly. 

 Some chanllenges faced while refactoring the code, included a lower understanding for certain Visual Studio Code features. For example, selecting the right elements and selectors to make the aplication look the same as the original code. 
 
 Some features I hope to implement in the future include to java script and css bootstrap to make the aplication more functional. 

The motivation for refactoring the code was the need to make Horiseon aplication more accessible. By doing this, it will help future coders better understad the code written
